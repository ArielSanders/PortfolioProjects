Hello, my name is Ariel and I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a BSIT and a MSIT.
<br>In this directory I post all of my data analytics projects. 
<br>The projects consist of ones I completed while I was in university and others are either personal projects or guided projects.
<br>The projects I have completed have allowed me to gain skills in:
<br>  -Tableau
<br>  -Power BI & PowerQuery
<br>  -MySQL
<br>  -SQL Server & SSMS
<br>  -Excel
