Hello, my name is Ariel and I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Master's in IT and a certificate in Data Analytics and Intelligent Technology.
<br>In this repository I post all of my data analytics projects. 
<br>The projects consist of ones I completed while I was in university and others are either personal projects or guided projects.
<br>The tools I use to complete my projects are:
<br>  -Tableau
<br>  -Power BI
<br>  -MySQL
<br>  -Excel
